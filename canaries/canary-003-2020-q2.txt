The Grin security contacts who have digitally signed this canary state the following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is April 8, 2020.

2. The latest Grin release is v3.1.1 `2cfbb92`

plausible explanation.

None.

Disclaimers and notes
----------------------

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration
makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary
declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other
means, like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce
us to produce false declarations.

The block hashes quoted below (Proof of freshness) serve to demonstrate
that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.
It shows that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any
guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to
anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible
for any of the statements made here.
